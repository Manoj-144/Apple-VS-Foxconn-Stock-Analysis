# Apple vs Foxconn Stock Analysis

This project explores the relationship between **Apple Inc.** and **Foxconn**, focusing on their stock performances. Foxconn is a major manufacturer for Apple, producing products like iPhones and iPads, making these two companies closely intertwined in the global supply chain. The analysis looks at stock prices, trading volumes, and the market impact of specific product releases. Additionally, an interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize the findings and provide a user-friendly interface for data exploration.

## Project Overview

The analysis was carried out by collecting product names and release dates for Apple products, using web scraping techniques. The project is not restricted to a particular time period; rather, it focuses on analyzing stock performance from the release dates of selected products. 

## Why Compare Apple and Foxconn?

Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics contract manufacturer, is a key partner of Apple, assembling the majority of its devices. This close connection allows us to study how product releases from Apple can affect both companies' stock prices and trading volumes. By comparing Apple, the brand, and Foxconn, the manufacturer, we can gain insights into how different stages of the supply chain influence market performance.

## Steps for Data Collection

1. **Web Scraping**:
   - I utilized web scraping to gather product release dates and names of significant Apple products. This data was used to align stock performance with the release of these products.
   
2. **APIs for Stock Data**:
   - Historical stock prices and trading volumes were obtained for both Apple and Foxconn using financial data APIs. This data was processed to facilitate analysis related to specific product release periods.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - After collecting the data, I cleaned and structured it to ensure consistency. This involved handling missing values and normalizing the datasets for both companies.

## Analysis Performed

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Key metrics such as closing prices, daily price changes, and volume changes were compared between the two companies, highlighting their interdependent market behavior.

## Key Findings from the Analysis

1. **Impact of Apple Product Launches**:
   - The release of major Apple products such as new iPhones showed a clear impact on Apple's stock price and trading volumes. Foxconn's stock, while less directly influenced, also saw spikes in volume during these periods, reflecting its critical role as Apple's manufacturer.

2. **Apple Stock Performance**:
   - On the final analyzed date, Apple's stock closed at **$191.80**, with a **-0.54%** price change. The volume, however, increased dramatically, suggesting high market activity.

3. **Foxconn Stock Performance**:
   - Foxconn closed at **$101.89** with a **0.48%** increase in price, and trading volumes saw a notable increase as well, mirroring trends seen in Apple's stock.

4. **Stock Volume Patterns**:
